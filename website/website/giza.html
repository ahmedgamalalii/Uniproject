              <h2>Pharaonic Village</h2>
              <p>The Pharaonic Village The idea of the Pharaonic village began with a dream,
                where Dr. Hassan Ragab thought of creating a living museum that includes real
                people wearing Pharaonic uniforms who embody the ancient Egyptian life. Therefore,
                in 1974 Dr. Hassan Ragab started transforming Yaqoub Island into a very identical
                model for the life of the ancient Egyptians.</p>
